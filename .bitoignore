# cutom ignore rules
# The order of patterns in the file matters.
# Patterns are processed from top to bottom, and the first pattern 
# that matches a file or directory dictates whether it is ignored or not.

# Ignore specific file named "config.ini"
config.ini

# Ignore all files with a '.bak' extension
*.bak

# Ignore all files with a '.kunal' extension
*.kunal

# If you want to exempt a file, make sure the exception pattern (!) 
# appears after the matching pattern.

# Ignore all files with a '.html' extension, except 'about.html'
*.html
!about.html

# Exclude directories
backup
temp/
dist

# matches any single character in a filename or directory name
