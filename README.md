# gdn-api
# By: BJ Barrera

In this API we are querying Whatsonchain twice to obtain and complete the details of a certain transaction, combining the results of the first query with the objective spent transaction ID (if it exists) of the output index determined by the main library. 
This API REST has the only purpose of complementing the RUN-SDK library to make it work properly.
